# About this repo

This repo contains multiple more or less esoteric implementations of an "escapHTML"-function.

I had hoped that some implementations would be faster. But in the end, the fastest one appeared to be
https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-escape, which is already 7 years old, but still good.
